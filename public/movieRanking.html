    <h1>The Best Movies According to Din</h1>

    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

    <hr>

    <h3>Interstellar</h3>

    <p>
        A journey through the cosmos. A delightful movie that outshines the the world of Sci Fi movies. This movie is definitely on of the greatest movies ever made.

    <h3>Back Door Sluts 9</h3>

    <p>
        A movie that is mentioned in the cartoon show, South Park. The cultural reference takes me back to my teenage days where me and few friends found the porn stash. This must be how the people during the goldrush felt finding gold. A golden movie indeed!

    <h3>Godzilla(1998)</h3>

    <p>
        This was one of the first movies I ever fell in love with. To this day, I have watch this movie over a hundred times! Watching Godzilla wreak havoc on NYC was evrything I could ever wish for and more!
